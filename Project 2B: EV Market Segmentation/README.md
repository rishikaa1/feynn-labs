# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation Analysis in India

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India, focusing on market segmentation and entry strategy for a potential EV startup, specifically targeting the two-wheeler segment.

## Contents

- `Report.pdf`: A detailed report covering the entire analysis, insights, and strategic recommendations for market entry.
- `ev_segmentation.ipynb`: Colab notebook containing Python code for data preprocessing, analysis, PCA, and KMeans clustering, along with visualizations.
- `datasets/`: A directory containing all datasets used for the analysis.

## Datasets

1. **`RS_Session_260_AU_1872_A_and_B.csv`** & **`ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24.csv`**: Annual EV sales by category (2018-2023).
2. **`statewise_distribution_of_ev.csv`**: State-wise distribution of EVs across India.
3. **`Questionnaire.docx`** & **`Response.csv`**: Consumer behavior survey data collected through a structured questionnaire focusing on knowledge, attitudes, and practices around EV adoption.
4. **`bike_dataset.csv`**: Contains technical specifications and performance metrics of various electric two-wheelers, such as price, mileage, weight, and top speed.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis focuses on identifying the most promising customer segments for EV adoption and crafting an entry strategy for the startup.

### Steps:

1. **Fermi Estimation**: Initial rough market sizing and potential revenue estimation.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transformation, and integration of multiple datasets for consistent analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into key trends, sales, and consumer preferences.
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction to identify significant features.
5. **KMeans Clustering**: Market segmentation based on key variables like price, mileage, and performance to identify distinct consumer groups.
6. **Visualization**: Graphs and charts showcasing the analysis results.

## Key Findings

- **Two-Wheeler Dominance**: The Indian EV market is heavily skewed toward two-wheelers, making it the most viable segment for entry.
- **Target Segment**: Higher-income consumers in urban areas who are inclined towards premium, high-performance two-wheelers.
- **Consumer Preferences**: The target group favors electric two-wheelers with high mileage, lightweight design, and top-tier acceleration speed.
