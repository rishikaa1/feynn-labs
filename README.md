This project also includes an abstract product design, implementation details, and unique market strategies.

**Industries Covered**:
- Tourism
- Agriculture
- Education
- Supply Chain
- Medical, etc.

**Key Components**:
- Business Problem Identification
- Product Ideation and Prototype Design
- Abstract Product Model and Implementation Strategy
