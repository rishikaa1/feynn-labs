## Project 1: AI Product/Service Prototyping for Small Businesses

**Objective**:  
Identify real-world markets where AI can be applied to small and medium-sized businesses and come up with a sellable AI product or service idea. The focus was on ideating a product prototype that primarily uses AI/ML to solve business challenges. This project also includes an abstract product design, implementation details, and unique market strategies.

**Industries Covered**:
- Tourism
- Agriculture
- Education
- Supply Chain
- Medical, etc.

**Key Components**:
- Business Problem Identification
- Product Ideation and Prototype Design
- Abstract Product Model and Implementation Strategy

**Folder**: `Project 1: AI Product Prototyping for Small Businesses`

## Project 3: AI Product/Service Prototype Development and Business/Financial Modelling

**Objective**:  
Develop an AI product/service prototype based on the idea from Project 1. This project includes building a small-scale code implementation of the prototype and creating a business and financial model around the product to assess its feasibility, viability, and monetization potential.

**Key Components**:
- Prototype Selection: Feasibility, Viability, and Monetization of the Product
- Prototype Development: Code Implementation or Basic Prototype
- Business Modelling: Strategy to Introduce the Product into the Market
- Financial Modelling: Revenue Prediction Using Regression Models or Time Series Forecasting

**Folder**: `Project 3: AI Product/Service Prototype Development and Business/Financial Modelling`
